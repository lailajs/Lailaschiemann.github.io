            Among Us

        <div class = "text4">
            Simulated the popular game "Among Us" with an Impostor mode and Ghost mode. Used Minimum Spanning Trees, Prims Algorithm, Branch and Bound Algorithm, and TSP Heuristics to find the best possible path between rooms given different player modes. Wrote test cases from scatch to debug code.

            Wrote program to emulate a relational database using a standard query language as the interface. Designed and planned multiple functions using differing abstract data types such as unordered maps as the back bone of hash functions, functors, maps as the backbone of binary search trees, vectors and original class types to efficiently evaluate different representations of the same data, and create a program that utilized efficent runn time and memory storage.

            Mine all Mine

        <div class = "text21">
            Used several kinds of priority queues, inheritance and dynamic polymorphism to escape from a mine using dynamite sticks. Needing to make the most of each dynamite stick, I used these data structures to blast piles of rubble that would take the fewest sticks of dynamite to destroy. Wrote test cases from scatch to debug code.

            Wrote a simulator for the Michigan card game Euchre, a trick taking game with 24 playing cards and groups of 4. This project utilized abstract data types, object oriented programming and polymorphism to create a simple player simulation as well as a human player simulation, where the user inputs decisions

        <div class = "text3">
            Given "simple" and "complex" dictionaries, I used queues, stacks, and deques to morph words given a unique set of tasks: such as reversal (&desserts = desserts and stressed) which would change and adapt based on the user inputted decision to use a queue or stack based format. Wrote test cases from scatch to debug code.

            This interactive musical guessing game called DJ183, is a python, css, and html site created from scratch. Our team researched and taught ourselves how to design front end html, as well as code back end python, even utilizing web scraping and firebase techniques.
